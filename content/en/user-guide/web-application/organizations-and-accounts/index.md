  Accounts and Organizations offer a flexible way of managing your needs within the LocalStack domain.
---

A LocalStack account is a precondition to get your LocalStack licenses, which allow you to use advanced features of LocalStack, such as LocalStack Pro services, Stack Insights, and more (fill in more here with a couple links?).<br>
To create an account for LocalStack, please visit our [web application](https://app.localstack.cloud/sign-up).
When signing up for an account, you can either do so by providing an e-mail, or by signing up with one of our social identity providers (such as GitHub).


### Individual Account / Company Account
After successfully signing up for a LocalStack, you will end up with an <b>individual account</b>.
These accounts are intended for non company entities, such as sole developers.<br>
Within the [profile](https://app.localstack.cloud/account) section of your account, you will find a toggle to switch to a <b>company account</b> instead.
This will allow you to add more information about your company, such as `Company Name`, `Country` and `Tax ID`, which should be set if you are acting on behalf of a company.

### Organizations
Both individual and company accounts are able to invite other accounts into their organization.<br>
Accounts that are invited to an organization can also be given advanced role settings by the organization admin, 
such as purchasing subscriptions, managing payment methods, and more.
<br>Organizations offer an easy way to manage subscriptions and api keys for multiple people.
For example you can purchase a plan with multiple seats for your organization, of which the resulting API keys can then be allocated among your organization members.
